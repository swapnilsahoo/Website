    <!-- Chosen Palette: Earthy Harmony -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is structured as a narrative journey for an MBA student. It begins with foundational theory (Porter's Generic Strategies) presented in a clear, comparative format. This section uses interactive tabs and a comparison chart to facilitate understanding of the core concepts. The app then pivots to a deep-dive case study on Patagonia, structured thematically. It explores Patagonia's history, its multi-faceted differentiation strategy, and the innovative ownership model, now including a strategic simulation. This structure was chosen to first equip the user with theoretical tools and then allow them to apply these tools to a complex, real-world example. The flow encourages exploration, with clickable elements revealing deeper insights, moving from 'what are the strategies?' to 'how does a real company apply, and even transcend, these strategies?'. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Porter's Strategies: Goal: Compare & Inform. Method: Interactive tabs for each strategy (Cost Leadership, Differentiation, Focus) and a summary bar chart. Interaction: Clicking tabs reveals detailed descriptions, examples, and pitfalls. The chart provides a high-level visual comparison. Justification: This allows for both quick overview and detailed exploration, catering to different learning paces. Library: Chart.js for the comparative chart.
        - Patagonia's Evolution: Goal: Show Change. Method: An interactive timeline built with HTML/CSS. Interaction: Hovering or clicking on timeline points reveals key milestones. Justification: A timeline is the most intuitive way to present historical progression and strategic evolution.
        - Patagonia's Differentiation: Goal: Organize & Inform. Method: A grid of interactive cards, each representing a pillar of differentiation (Operations, Product, Brand, Mission). Interaction: Clicking a card flips it or expands it to show detailed examples. Justification: This organizes complex, multi-layered information into digestible chunks and encourages user interaction to uncover details.
        - Ownership Model Analysis: Goal: Compare & Analyze. Method: A dynamic diagram comparing rejected ownership models with the final chosen structure. Interaction: Users can click on different options (IPO, PE Sale, ESOP, etc.) to see a summary of pros, cons, and why Patagonia rejected it, contrasting it with the selected Trust/Collective model. Justification: This visual comparison makes the complex decision-making process behind the new ownership structure clear and understandable. Library: Chart.js for a radar chart comparing models on key criteria.
        - Strategic Simulation: Goal: Enable user choice & show impact. Method: Interactive buttons for decisions, Radar Chart (Chart.js) for metric impact, and dynamic textual feedback. Interaction: User clicks a decision, chart and text update. Justification: Provides a direct, experiential learning opportunity for applying strategic concepts and understanding trade-offs.
        - CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

                <p class="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700">To kick off today's session, let's consider a fundamental question: **How does a company pursue competitive advantage across its chosen market scope?** Michael Porter's generic strategies describe the answers, and that's precisely what we'll delve into. We will begin with his foundational Generic Strategies framework and then apply these concepts to a compelling, real-world case study: Patagonia. Through interactive exploration, you will analyze how a company's mission can profoundly influence its strategic positioning and even challenge the traditional boundaries of capitalism.</p>

                                    <li>**Walmart:** As one of the world's largest retailers, Walmart's massive buying power allows it to negotiate significantly lower prices from suppliers. It then passes these savings on to its customers, leading to its signature "Everyday Low Prices" strategy. Walmart's supply chain is highly optimized, using sophisticated technology to track products and reduce costs throughout the distribution process. It strategically locates stores close to each other and utilizes a technique called cross-docking to streamline inventory management, further minimizing expenses. Walmart streamlines its operations, reduces waste, and maximizes productivity through technology, automation, and employee training.</li>

Apple is known for its sleek, minimalist designs, and user-friendly interfaces, which set its products apart from competitors. They constantly innovate and offer unique features like superior cameras, seamless device integration, and a focus on privacy in their operating systems. Apple creates a cohesive ecosystem of hardware (iPhones, iPads, Macs, Apple Watches) and software (iOS, macOS, watchOS), ensuring seamless integration and a superior user experience. This ecosystem fosters strong customer loyalty, making users more likely to stay within the Apple family of products. Apple's branding emphasizes quality, innovation, and premium craftsmanship, positioning its products as luxury and aspirational items. Its marketing campaigns often use storytelling and emotional appeals to resonate with consumers on a personal level.</li>

                                    <li>**Boutique Hotel Chains:** Boutique hotels are a great example of a focus strategy, catering to a specific niche of travelers seeking unique, personalized experiences rather than a standardized hotel stay. They target travelers who prioritize aesthetics, unique design, personalized service, and local immersion over chain-hotel consistency and lower prices. They offer a more intimate and tailored experience with distinctive decor, locally inspired designs, and highly personalized customer service. This might include themed rooms, unique amenities, locally sourced food, or curated experiences that reflect the surrounding culture. Boutique hotels excel at anticipating and fulfilling guests' needs, providing a warm and welcoming environment with meticulous attention to detail. They might offer personalized greetings, customized amenities, and insider tips from staff who are often local experts.</li>
                                    <li>**Lululemon:** Successfully focuses on the niche market of premium athletic apparel and yoga-inspired clothing, tailoring its products and brand image to fitness enthusiasts.</li>

                    <p>Patagonia's journey illustrates that a differentiation strategy can be built on more than just product features; it can be a deeply embedded organizational philosophy. Its authenticity and unwavering commitment to its mission create a competitive moat that is nearly impossible for rivals to replicate.</p>
                    <p>The "Earth Is Now Our Only Shareholder" model transforms this differentiation from a strategic choice into an <strong class="text-[#004B5A]">existential imperative</strong>. While this reinforces the brand, it also introduces new tensions: the pressure to remain profitable for a cause, balancing employee needs with planetary needs, and facing intense public scrutiny.</p>
                    <p>Ultimately, Patagonia's strategy is an ambitious experiment in redefining capitalism. Its success or failure will provide invaluable lessons on whether a business can truly subordinate profit to purpose, inspiring a new model for how corporations can address the world's most pressing challenges.</p>

However, this bold move came with a slight decrease in Financial Performance due to the substantial investment, and it also exposed the company to increased public scrutiny and potential backlash from those who disagreed with its political stance.`
