    <!-- Chosen Palette: Earthy Harmony -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as a single-page, scrollable narrative for an MBA session. It begins with foundational theory (Wheel of Strategy, Porter's Generic Strategies) and transitions to a deep-dive case study on Patagonia, including its history, multi-layered differentiation, and unique ownership model. A key feature is the integration of a detailed script for an on-stage "SkyPilot Airlines" cost leadership simulation, designed for live classroom enactment. This structure allows a seamless flow from theory to application and then to interactive practice, all within one continuous, easy-to-navigate document. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Wheel of Strategy: Goal: Inform. Method: A precise, hand-coded SVG diagram to accurately replicate the provided image, ensuring clarity and scalability. Interaction: Static visual anchor for the introduction. Justification: SVG provides the best fidelity for complex diagrams on the web.
        - Porter's Strategies: Goal: Compare & Inform. Method: Interactive tabs for each strategy, populated with detailed examples. A Chart.js bar chart provides a visual summary. Interaction: Clicking tabs reveals detailed content. Justification: Manages information density and allows focused exploration.
        - Patagonia Case: Goal: Analyze & Explore. Method: A vertical timeline (HTML/CSS), expandable cards for differentiation pillars, and interactive buttons for the ownership dilemma, supported by a Chart.js radar chart. Interaction: Clicks reveal deeper information layers. Justification: Breaks down a complex case into digestible, interactive segments.
        - Cost Leadership Simulation: Goal: Apply & Enact. Method: A detailed textual script formatted for a live, on-stage role-playing exercise. Interaction: A "Show/Hide Outcomes" button for the facilitator to control the reveal of information during the enactment. Justification: Provides a practical, hands-on learning experience that complements the theoretical content.
        - CONFIRMATION: NO Mermaid JS used. -->

                            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Wal-Mart, founded by Sam Walton in 1962, became the world's largest company by rigorously pursuing cost leadership. Early growth came from discount stores in smaller towns. In the 1980s, heavy investments in IT managed its supply chain, enabling expansion into metropolitan areas and later Supercenters (food retailing) and "neighborhood markets."</p>
                            <p class="text-gray-700">Despite its success, Wal-Mart faced criticism for strategies that "killed competition," leading to fears of anti-trust suits for monopolistic practices. Christopher Hoyt, president of Hoyt & Company, noted, "The only thing that could stop Wal-Mart is if the government gets involved, just as it did with Microsoft."</p>

                    <p>Patagonia's journey illustrates that a differentiation strategy can be built on more than just product features; it can be a deeply embedded organizational philosophy. Its authenticity and unwavering commitment to its mission create a competitive moat that is nearly impossible for rivals to replicate.</p>
                    <p>The "Earth Is Now Our Only Shareholder" model transforms this differentiation from a strategic choice into an <strong class="text-[#004B5A]">existential imperative</strong>. While this reinforces the brand, it also introduces new tensions: the pressure to remain profitable for a cause, balancing employee needs with planetary needs, and facing intense public scrutiny.</p>
                    <p>Ultimately, Patagonia's strategy is an ambitious experiment in redefining capitalism. Its success or failure will provide invaluable lessons on whether a business can truly subordinate profit to purpose, inspiring a new model for how corporations can address the world's most pressing challenges.</p>

However, this bold move came with a slight decrease in Financial Performance due to the substantial investment, and it also exposed the company to increased public scrutiny and potential backlash from those who disagreed with its political stance.`
